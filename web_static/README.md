## Introduction 

* During this project, I learned how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is  used to write the structure of a web page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design.

* This is a progresive task to work on AirBnb console project, and therefore it tries to structure the front side or client side view of Our Console project
